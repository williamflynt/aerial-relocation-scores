        You can think of the HSL color space as a cylinder.
          * Hue is the angle around the central vertical axis
          * Saturation is the distance from this axis
          * Luminance is the height on the vertical axis

        This method limits considered hue values to those where the luminance is
        above 10% and the saturation is within the middle 90%.

        It then creates a two-dimensional histogram, slicing the hue-saturation
        cylinder radially into 50 sections (for 100 color slices) and horizontally
        into 2 sections. This is like a pie cut into wedges, then  cutting each
        wedge in half somewhere between the crust and pointy slice tip.

        Each cell in the histogram represents the proportion of pixels in the image
        that fall within the corresponding hue and luminance range.
